R11.1:
a. cast
b. no
c. cast :)

R11.2:
a.
b. throw exception? :1
c.

R11.3:
a.
b.
c.
d.no
e.might throw exception (RUNTIME)
f.must CAST
g.
h.no

R11.4: you lose information when casting primitive types
you risk the chance of cause an error when casting interface as a specific class

R11.6:
a.
b.
c.no
d.no
e.no
f.yes??
g.yes?

R11.7: it is polymorphism because you are calling a method from the shape interface.
The compiler does not know which implementation of that method (the object) until runtime.

R11.8: early binding occurs during method overloading. 
An example includes if two methods have the same name (but different parameters)
idk.getRandom(10,20); 
idk.getRandom(10);
