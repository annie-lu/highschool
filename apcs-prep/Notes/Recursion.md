* a recursive method is a method that calls itself
  * consists of a base case/termination condition
  * a non-basecase whose actions move the algorithm toward termination

* *tail recursion* has no pending statements following the recursive call

* *infinite recursion* has no base case/never reaches base case it causes Stack Overflow error

* recursive methods can always be written iteratively
* though in some cases, recursive methods are a lot more intuitive/faster

* writing recursive methods
  * frame a process in terms of a simpler case of itself
  * maybe describe the method before actually
  * writing the method

* recursive helper method
  * have a public nonrecursive driver method
  * that calls a private recursive method
  
  
(idk what this means, but this is what my teacher said and this might help, idk) 

*How To Recursion:* write the method as if you already wrote it
