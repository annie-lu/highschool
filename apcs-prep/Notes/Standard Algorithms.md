*these notes probably don't make sense*

*ask me for explanation*

*finding the extreme* 
* store the index or the object

*removing from array list*
* for loop
* remove something, decrement i
* or go backwards

*remove adjacent duplicate values*
* compare 2 each loop
* dont go out of bounds

* start loops later
* than end earlier??
> off by one error

* index traverses 1d
* loop the 2d’

* don’t use a for loop
* use a while loop
* find the index trying to insert
* insert it there

* increment i
